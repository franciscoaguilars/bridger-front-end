            <div className="col-lg-8 col-sm-12">
              <p>Smart Reach is a not-for-profit tutoring service founded on the idea that by providing educational support to economically disadvantaged students, we can bridge societal, medical, educational, and economical gaps between people, communities, and cities alike. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and ever increasing wage gaps, students who are disadvantaged have more barriers to their success than ever, with students from lower socioeconomic status communities consistently scoring behind their more privileged peers. Adding to this pressure, now the interpersonal knowledge that fosters curiosity and an interest in learning is no longer present. It is our goal to empower these students and make resources available to them so that they may meet their potential regardless of the circumstances they find themselves in at the current moment.

            <div className="col-lg-8 col-sm-12">
              <p>We are a group of individuals who aim to utilize the skills and knowledge we have gained through our personal educational achievement to bridge the gap in quality education through free tutoring services for students that are not sufficiently served by their current education systems. We hope to work with these students to create equality between all communities in the strength and quality of the education that young minds receive. We are qualified to serve each student with an individualistic and holistic approach as a result of our tutors’ expansive educational experiences and thorough knowledge of college and graduate admissions processes.

              <p>We strive to bridge the educational gap in today’s society; to help better the future of bright individuals through improved resources, tutoring, education, and mentorship.

              <p>As a result of the pandemic we recognize students are experiencing a decrease in accessible resources and academic support. With many schools transitioning to online learning, we are aware of what differentiates an in-person classroom setting from a virtual at-home setting. We understand the difficulties that accompany virtual learning, which is why we aim to ease some of the strain caused by this change in learning modalities. We will be conducting all tutoring appointments through virtual meeting tools, however once restrictions have been lifted you may have the option of meeting tutors and students in person to create an even more effective educational experience.
